That's a very interesting project, Mohamed. It sounds like you addressed a real need for recruiters by automating parts of the interview process. Using Whisper for STT, ElevenLabs for TTS, Gemini for the LLM, LangGraph for agent logic, and Streamlit for deployment shows a good grasp of various relevant technologies.

Now, to shift gears slightly, let's talk about the broader AI landscape.

Question 49: What defines a Large Language Model (LLM)?
